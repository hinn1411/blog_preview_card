## My process

- Creating HTML structure for the challenge
- Styling with CSS
- Researching new knowledge
- Fixing some bugs and unexpected behaviors

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, Cursor, Pseudo-classes)

### What I learned

I learned an interesting CSS snippet. It is used to select all directive elements of a parent, except the first one.
```css
.main-author_container > *:not(:first-child) {
  margin-left: 12px;
}
```


### Continued development

Continuing to learn CSS pseudo classes & elements for better element selection.
